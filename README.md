This repository contains a made up VS Code extension and a couple of JSON files. They are intended as a technical writing training exercise in Github.

## Prerequisites

Before attending this training:

- Create an account on [Github.com](www.github.com) and provide your usename to Zeibura
  - Note that this is NOT the same github as github.gwd.broadcom.net, which uses the okta ID as the username.
- Download [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Exercise 1

Add or change some content in the /src/content.json file (literally anything). Use the following workflow: 

1. Create a branch
2. Make commits
3. Open a pull request 
4. Assign the pull request
5. Address any comments we leave on the pull request by making further commits to your branch
6. Close or merge the pull request when instructed

## Exercise 2

You will be assigned an open pull request for review. Review the pull request and either accept it or suggest changes. Leave inline comments on the changed files view if you can.

## Exercise 3

We are going to release a new version of the VS Code extension in the /vscode_client folder. Remember to update:

- the README.md file with any changes to the user documentation
- the CHANGELOG.md file with the new release information
- the version number in the package.json file
